> Node-RED Nodes for MicroControl &micro;MIC.200 controller

With these Nodes you can connect the internal interfaces of the 
[MicroControl ÂµMIC.200 controller](https://www.microcontrol.net/en/products/control-units/) to 
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/). 


## Requirements

- &micro;MIC.200 controller

The library `umic/libs/umic200` provides dummy functions for the internal interfaces of the
&micro;MIC.200 controller, so the nodes can be evaluated on any system.



## Development

To test the node module locally the `npm install <folder>` command can be used. This allows you to develop the node in a local 
directory and have it linked into a local node-red install during development.

In your node-red user directory, typically `~/.node-red`, run:

```shell
npm install <location of node module>
```
 

## Install

- install manually
- install from node-red


## How to use

- available nodes
